## [PL 0.5.0] - 2026-06-23 — Banks at interview scope: 56 Python + 41 pandas

> Researched what senior SWE/DS/MLE/DA/BA/PA/AIE are expected to code, then expanded both banks to interview scope.

### Added
- **Python Drills → 56** across 11 patterns: hashing, two-pointers, sliding-window, prefix-sum, stack, binary-search, heap/top-K, intervals, greedy, **numpy-ml** (RMSE, min-max normalize, accuracy, cosine similarity, one-hot, softmax — for the DS/MLE audience), recursion.
- **pandas → 41** across 10 patterns: groupby (+rank / top-N-per-group, transform, named-agg, share-of-total), merge (+anti-join, indicator, concat), reshape (melt / crosstab / stack-unstack), window (rolling / diff / cumsum / pct_change / resample), missing data, selection / query / nlargest, metrics / safe-rates, dedup / rank, datetime.

### Notes
- **120 problems total** (23 gotchas + 56 Python + 41 pandas). Every solution + test **independently re-verified** out of the built JS in CPython + pandas 2.3 — **337 checks, 100% pass**. Authored original; the interview canon used only as a pattern taxonomy (moat). esbuild green. Pyodide ships pandas ~2.0/2.1; the APIs used are stable across pandas 1.5–2.3 — confirm on the live deploy.

## [PL 0.4.0] - 2026-06-23 — Python Drills + pandas banks (test-based)

> First coding content beyond Bank A: drills you implement and run against hidden tests, in real Python and pandas.

### Added
- **Test-based problem runner** — `runProblem()` in the Pyodide runtime runs your solution + a hidden `__pl_checks` harness, returning per-check pass/fail + glass-box time/memory. `loadPackages()` lazy-loads the pandas/numpy wheels on the first pandas problem. New `ProblemRunner` + generic `ProblemBrowser` (read prompt → write function → Run tests → reveal model solution).
- **Bank C (first slice) — Python Drills** (`src/data/pythonProblems.js`): 6 famous problems by pattern (hashing, sliding window, stack, prefix sum) — first-unique, two-sum, anagram, longest-unique-run, balanced-brackets, first-day-over-target. Original, analyst-framed.
- **Bank D (first slice) — pandas / numpy** (`src/data/pandasProblems.js`): 5 analyst ops — revenue-by-category (groupby), new-user AOV (filter-before-aggregate), no-fanout merge, month×category pivot, vectorized tiering (np.where).
- DO nav gains two live banks (in the accordion); `problemProgress.js` (per-bank localStorage); `PythonCell` gains `onCodeChange`; `Icon` gains `x`.

### Notes
- 11 problems, **38/38 checks verified** in CPython + pandas 2.3 before shipping. esbuild bundle green (main ~139kb). pandas wheel loads on demand in-browser. Sourcing: original problems, the interview canon used as taxonomy only (moat).

## [PL 0.3.0] - 2026-06-23 — BreakLabs logo (D-19)

> The unified BreakLabs lockup lands. `break⌇labs · Programming` — one brand, distinct rooms.

### Added
- **`BrandMark` component** (`src/components/shared/BrandMark.jsx`) per `HQ/BRANDMARK-ROLLOUT.md` (D-19). Three variants (full / wordmark / monogram). Constant across all labs: the red fault-glyph seam + the `break⌇labs` wordmark. Per-lab: descriptor `Programming` + violet `#8B5CF6` accent.
- Wired into **7 slots**: sidebar header (full), favicon (shared red monogram), OG share card, hero (wordmark), gate header (wordmark), footer (wordmark + "part of BreakLabs"), loading (monogram).
- **OG share card** — `public/og-image.png` (1200×630, the instrument card + lockup) + `og:`/`twitter:` meta in `index.html`.
- **Sidebar Standard nav** — rebuilt the left nav to the HQ four-frame accordion spec (`DESIGN-STANDARD.md`): KNOW/DO/BUILD/JUDGE as collapsible accordions, one-open-per-level, measured-height animation (`scrollHeight`, 0.30s ease-out), chevrons, a flat TRACK row (Home), follows-navigation auto-expand, `aria-expanded`/`aria-current`. Module-scoped `Collapsible`/`Chevron`/`NavItem`. Kept PL's SOON badges + violet active pill.

### Changed
- Favicon is now the shared BreakLabs red glyph (was the violet PL stopgap — archived to `_legacy/`, D-18).

## [PL 0.2.0] - 2026-06-23 — Instrument identity + dark/light

> PL stops wearing PAL's skin and takes its own. Direction: **Instrument** (the BreakLabs "dark glass-box that exposes the machine"), the most on-brand and most distinct of three proposed.

### Added
- **Instrument theme (dark-first):** void `#0A0A0B` base, panel surfaces, **violet `#8B5CF6`** accent (PL's assigned BreakLabs track colour), with the master semantics — gold `#F2B233` = signal, red `#FB5247` = break, green `#19C37D` = fix. Type switched to **Inter + JetBrains Mono** (the brand's display + voice).
- **Light "Field Notes" mode:** warm paper `#F4F1EA` + ink, violet kept. Toggled via `[data-theme]` on `<html>` (the sibling-lab mechanism), saved to `localStorage`, with an inline anti-flash script in `index.html`. Toggle (sun/moon) lives in the sidebar footer.
- **break-glyph identity:** `public/favicon.svg` (fault-glyph monogram, violet + gold) replacing the 404; the `break⌇labs` wordmark + fault-glyph mark in the sidebar.
- New `src/utils/theme.js`; `sun`/`moon` added to `Icon.jsx`.

### Notes
- Token swap only — no component rewrites. esbuild bundle verified (exit 0). Build/deploy on push (Vercel connected).

## [PL 0.1.0] - 2026-06-23 — Re-scope to Programming Lab + B0/B1

> Lab re-scoped from **Production Systems Lab** (infra ops) to **Programming Lab (PL)** — the SWE-for-data fluency lab (HQ D-07/D-15). The Dec-2024 infra modules below are archived in `_legacy/`. From here, this changelog tracks PL.

### Added
- **B0 — SPA foundation:** React + Vite + Pyodide app, sibling-consistent with PAL/MSL/GAL. Theme = PAL `index.css` tokens + `.pal-*` animation classes. Sidebar (KNOW/DO/BUILD/JUDGE), Icon, HowToStrip, ForwardPointerCard, GateOverlay (beta passthrough), unlock.
- **MVP IDE + glass-box:** `PythonCell` — CodeMirror 6 editor running real CPython via Pyodide 0.25.1. Glass-box built in immediately: stdout + wall time (`perf_counter`) + peak memory (`tracemalloc`), plus a `raceMethods()` helper for the future DSA canonical-vs-brute race.
- **B1 — Bank A (Python Gotchas):** 23 problems, 7 clusters. Each is predict-MCQ → runnable code → glass-box reveal → runnable fix → "Copy as LinkedIn post". Seeded by PY1–PY7; 16 newly authored. Every snippet verified in CPython.
- **Pages:** `GotchaBrowser` (cluster-grouped, mobile-safe grid) + `GotchaRunner`; `App` lazy-routes home ↔ gotchas.

### Changed
- Archived legacy infra (FastAPI/Docker/`modules`/`api`/`frontend`) to `_legacy/`.

### Notes
- Not yet `npm install`/`vite build`'d (macOS-only). Repo slug rename deferred. Pyodide currently main-thread (per MSL) — worker move flagged.
